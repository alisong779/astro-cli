# Astro::Cli

Welcome to the Astrology Source! This CLI scrapes the web site astrology.com for lists and details on all astrological signs and their planets. 
It allows the users to see a list of astrological signs, all of the details associated with their sign and/or the details associated with 
the planet that rules their sign.
